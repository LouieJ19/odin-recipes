Beginner HTML Practice Project

Project will test knowledge of HTML learned through the Odin Project's
Foundations section.

I have been slowly making my way through the HTML section, I find it 
interesting and can see how it is useful. I am looking forward to this
project, if not a little intimidated.

My computer skills need improvement, and this first project should be
good practice.
