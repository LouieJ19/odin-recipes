            <li>Sautee pancetta until crispy, but not burnt, bout 10-15 minutes. Turn heat off but leave pan in its place on the stove.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg and parmesean cheese with black pepper until it forms a semi-thick and grainily-smooth sauce. </li>
            <li>When pasta is done, drain the water and <strong>immediately</strong> throw the noodles into the cast iron pan with the pancetta bits.</li>
            <li>Quickly add the egg mixture to the pasta and toss it until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Twirl enough pasta to cover a craving for and serve nest of Carbonara pasta as a side dish or entree.</li>
